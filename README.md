# Limitation of Liability (Australia)

### Purpose

The limitation language in this repo is experimental language for limitation of liability in **Australian** legal agreements.

### Spectrum of Positions

There is more than one limitation of liability position in this repo - the file called:

- `au-limitation-0.md`, limits liability to the fullest extent available under the law; and
- `au-limitation-1.md`, limits liability to a certain amount.

### Use

The lanugage in this repo is not language that you can import wholesale with a simple incorporation by reference.  It assumes that you have included certain information in the clause that imports it.  The information that it relies on includes:

- a clear indicator of which party is doing the limiting;
- what the party is limiting liability in relation to (subject of liability); and
- a list of specific risks that liability is limited in relation to.

When you use `au-limitation-1.md`, you'll also need to indicate what the "liability cap" is.

### Not Legal Advice

This is not legal advice.  Lawyers are involved in producing these terms, but they obviously aren't familiar with your circumstances.  Speak to your lawyer to make sure that the limitation language is well aligned with your circumstances.

### Licence

The limitation lanauge is released under the license in license.md.
